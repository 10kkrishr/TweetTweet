# TweetTweet
This is a sample twitter like application. I have written this using Nodejs and Express. 

To install run "npm install"

To start the application run "node index.js"

I have created a session for Testuser2 with the following token "a09b55ed-1b8c-4039-b7a3-69b429820fd3" that should be passed in the Authorization header

Api route : http://localhost:8080/api/v1/feed

Header: Authorization a09b55ed-1b8c-4039-b7a3-69b429820fd3
